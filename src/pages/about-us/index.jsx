            The point of this program is to solve a problem, that I have been having while enjoying my 
            favorite state parks. You drive hours to get to a spring at a state park in florida. You see a long line
            of cars. Wouldn't it have been nice, if you could know that this place was closed and had too many people. 
            That way you can go and see the other places nearby.  What if RSVPing, actually meant something and you could
            get a text back saying: 'It's okay I am just busy rn with other people and we should see different people.' from 
            your local state park. Well if that's the problem that needs to be solved, then this application is perfect!
